# Evolutionary Robotics - CS 206 With Joshua Bongard
## Personal Repo for Jake Ten Eyck

Course followed along with the assignments from the Reddit online course found at https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/

Course work was based on the pybullet physics engine. Professor Bongard then created a custom inferface (pyrosim) to allow easier access to the inner workings of the engine. Assignments 1 - 10 followed along with the directions from the reddit page, and the final project was opened up to ideas from students. I chose to recreate the Spot robot dog as seen with Boston Dynamics, and have it evolve forward locomotion with a jumping or pronking behavior.

## Future goals for the project
- Increase the run times of individual simulations and the number of generations to get better behavior
- Fine tune the body structure and allow the synaptic weights for the arm motors to be randomized
- Have the arm grasp an object and lift it
